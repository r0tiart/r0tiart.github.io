Like life, code is what you make of it. Like life, coding gets frustrating when things aren't going your way. The smallest mistake or negligance can cause everything to come crashing down. However when there is frustration there is jubilance. when you can figure out what is causing the error and you finally progress to the next step in life there is a sense of satisfaction - even more so when you finally complete a project/lab. 

Like life, coding has incremental problems or hurdles one must get past to move on and grow. You take your lumps and become stronger, better and faster.
