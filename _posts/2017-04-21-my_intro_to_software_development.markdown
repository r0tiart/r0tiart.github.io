My coding journey started in college, with a required C++ course. Although throughly interesting, my path to graduation was set. I put the coding course behind me and I graduated with a BS in Business Management & Finance. As I began to start working full time, my enthusiasm for the roll gradually decreases over time. I always assumed it was just the current role I was in. 

As I progressed further into my career - each new opportunity bringing new excitment. However the gradual decrease in enthusiasm continues. It is not until recently that I've noticed that everytime my enthusiasm starts to wane I would always return to some sort or form of coding. 

Throughout the years post college, I have dabbled in code academy and have taken external courses for SQL. It was like a breath of fresh air, whenever i would dabble in code while my enthusiasm for current professional role has waned. It was not until recently (past year) that I've noticed it and once I did, my jorney began again. 

I sat back down with code academy - then continued to flatiron pre-bootcamp courses and here am I, going full fledge not slowing down at all.
