Revisiting code you have touched in even a week or so requires you to look over it again. Refreshing one's mind of what each line of code does in the specific file you are looking at is key. I've recently experienced this as I have revisited a project I have been randomly adding to.  I was trying to continue to work on the new feature upon I discovered I need recall what I wrote in my componenet, action and reducers. 

There is more of an appreciation for readiable code - even revisiting your own code that you have not seen in awhile takes some effort in processing what's happening. One's abilitiy to understand how an app works is important even if you do not know what every single function does. Memo to myself - when I start working on new code I will write notes on lines I alter and things I will be doing. A Repetitive nature will force it into my muscle memory and intern will make me a better developer. 

Now what was I adding to this code? I was adding another file attachment - a pdf. I converted said pdf into a filebase64 and tranfered it to my back in api successfully. Now i just need to work on my API so that it updates correctly. Trial and error is key to debugging. When something goes wrong through a debugger, throw a binding.pry (depending on the language you are using). Throw in console.log or puts - just to see what is outputting. Knowing is half the battle.
