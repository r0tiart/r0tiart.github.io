I recently checked out some Ted talks on education and tech. There were a couple of inspirations of what peaked my curiosity. I've recently been in contact with a company called New Visions that has recently started a tech department to help improve the technical infrastructure of public schools. 

There was one that has particularly peaked my interest https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_let_s_teach_for_mastery_not_test_scores#t-637945. The gist of this ted talk was concerning the entire structure of the curriculum. On a typical curriculum they teach you a lesson, give you homework and then after two weeks or so a test and you move on to the next topic. Students don't have the opportunity to sure up the missing gaps in knowledge because you are pushed on to the next lessons. Your foundation is not good, when you add more knowledge upon a incomplete foundation, your building will crumble. 

My personal thought and experience with this is - it's true... you don't get a chance to fix the gaps you have, you're just shuttled into the next topic. What i'd like to see is more technology and tools educator and students can utilize to help improve oneself; i recall back then there was dial-a-teacher. But with technology now a days it should be more simple and more readily available. There should be some sort of interactive curriculum instructors can utilize that students themselves have access to on a regular basis - that they can go back to and recieve more examples of certain problems and possibly have a student teacher model; where students can volunteer to answer questions for other students (like how learn.co is at the moment). 

Technically speaking we are at a point in time where we have the ability to make that happen. The technology industry is growing yet the educational system has yet to improve that much or at all. Food for thought - introducing more technology into schools; utilizing and upgrading dated systems... So many ways technology can help improve our education system.
