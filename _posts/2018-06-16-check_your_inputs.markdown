One of the lessons from flatiron school was to make sure you validate your inputs - never trust user inputs. This thought came up recently where I read an article about using SQL queries as inputs and by doing so you can query certain information if it is allowed to be passed through into the back end. Anything that requires an outside source needs to be validated for security reasons, programming is so flexiable that without any forms of test or security it can be easily circumvented or altered in some malicious way. 

In react i believe it's called controlled inputs. Non controlled inputs are simple where it just takes it as is - you can defintely do it for certain things maybe... on second thought, just check your inputs whatever you want it to be, be it text/string make sure you are getting the correct information. It was defintely an interesting read, i'd never would've thought about passing SQL queries as strings to try to circumvent things or get certain information out of the server. If there is a will there is a way.
