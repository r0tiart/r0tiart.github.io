As the the amount of data we consume and needs to be stored increases an innate issue arises in the storage of said data. I recently read an article talking about sql and nosql and how data storage via either platform has it's pros and cons; nosql seems to be a growing idea - if there can be a unified language like "Sql" to query the data. I don't fully understand how nosql works, but it seems to be relatively cheaper to implement then SQL. To scale up cost effiency is a big factor for a lot of companies who can't afford sql.

It's interesting of what data can do and show you. The different approach to storing data is the main difference between the two. It's not a matter of which is better, but what is better suited for you and your project. There is a whole new world to explore in big data - coding is awesome..
