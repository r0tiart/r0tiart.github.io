I recently read this article entitled "Understanding git under the hood".  It was quite an interesting read, I'd defintely recomment the read to someone trying to understand how git works. It goes through a simple example of commiting 1 file 'a' then another 'b' and then commiting a change to 'a' and finally a change to 'b'. The general graph shows how git keeps data.

Further down the line you get to see the physical details of git. Each commit - shows the message, who committed it as well as the tree. Within the tree is a hash and the hash directs to the data that was commited. It is great way to learn how git works with visual and actual examples. [Here](https://medium.com/@mrbullian/understanding-git-under-the-hood-b05b1dd52dec) is the link to the article if anyone needss a better understanding of git. 

There are  options of an online version control like github, which utilizes git, but is just hosted online. What's good about theses services is that there is a visual representation of each commit and the structure of git already there, all layed out. Sometimes it's just worth playing around and looking at something.
