There are a vast array of information and places oyu can practice and pick up new knowledge and skillsets. I've been recently exploring the resources outside of flatiorn and codewars. I've been recently playing with hackerrank and the way it is structured is different then codewars. 

In HackerRank there are a set amount of questions - in increasing diffficulties, kind of like a funnel of experience. The way codewars work is a random question based on your current rank - the higher the rank the more difficult the questions. What I like about codewars is that after submitting your solution you get other indviduals solutions and you can compare and find possibly a better way to solve the problem. Whereas for HackerRank I wasn't able to find other individual solutions, yes there is a discussion board to ask questions like codewars, but after solving it there doesn't seem to be more knowledge gained after solving the solution like codewars. 

I've recently got some books at as well - originally i was going to check out javascript the good parts, but a friend of mine and another individual recently recommended Cracking the coding interview. 

I'd like to throw another online resource called Interview Cake - I like the way it's structured - they present you with a question ( however you aren't provided a location to solve it - but you can use your own editor to mimic the problem ).  I've only looked at one problem at the moment just to see how it was structure, but will surely return. The process of the question is to mimic your thought process that you should have in solving a solution - and progressing through better solutions.
