This was a large undertaking, as initially i was raking my brain on how to get started. But after a cooloff period, I thought calmly and ideas started to flood in and that I learned how to build both sides of it seperatly, but now i need to combine the two!! 

The ideas I had felt like it would be quicker then it was, oh boy the testing phases when my code breaks was the longest aspects of this project. Getting the right data to pass through to the API and the right JSON to render was the toughest part, just getting the two to speak to one another. The back end API was pretty basic Rails development, creating models and associating them to one another, I've added some additional things as well that I didn't implement yet that I was thinking of to continue to add to this project. 

I had to utilize multiple life cycle event hooks in react to get the things to render correctly - after pulling data from the API, i didn't want it to pull to soon or late. Attaching the image was pretty difficult task, I had no idea how to get from the Client to the API as my API Rails app was utilizing the paperclip gem to store images. it took a lot of googling to figure out which dependency i needed to add to my React app. 

All in all this was by far the toughest project, but I feel very accomplished.
