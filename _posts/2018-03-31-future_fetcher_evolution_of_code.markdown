So I recently read an article about the end of Redux and welcoming Future Fetcher. The article talks about how redux has been falling out of favor with developers due to its complexity. The idea of Future Fetcher is to bring a simpler way of state management. 

Redux was the go to option for state management for the past two years. The article does state Redux is not obsolete in anyway, but the average web app doesn’t need all the complexities Redux comes with. 

My personal though in the matter is, wow…it took two years for some sort of transition into something else to begin. However, it is also quite exciting coming into the world of development. It just shows how there is never ending growth of technology. It is like a living organism, constantly evolving. –forever learning.
